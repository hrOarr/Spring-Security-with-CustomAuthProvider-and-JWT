##  Introduction

In modern applications, securing APIs and user authentication is a crucial aspect of system design. This project implements **Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication**, supporting multiple authentication providers.

---

##  Features
#### 1. Multiple Authentication Providers
- **DAO Authentication Provider** ‚Äì Authenticates users from the database (username & password).
- **Custom Authentication Provider** ‚Äì Supports additional authentication mechanisms

#### 2. JWT-Based Authentication
- Implements **stateless authentication** using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
- Uses **signed JWTs** to prevent tampering.
- Supports **token expiration & refresh mechanisms**.

#### 3. Secure API Authorization
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for different user roles.
- Uses **JWT claims** to determine access permissions.
- Protects API endpoints with **Spring Security filters**.

#### 4. Stateless and Scalable Security
- No session storage required (**session-less authentication**).
- Works well with **microservices & distributed systems**.
- API requests include JWT in **Authorization Header (`Bearer <token>`)**.

#### 6. CSRF Protection
- Eliminates **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) risks** by avoiding cookies.

#### 7. Security Best Practices
- **BCrypt password hashing** for user credentials.
- Implements **refresh token mechanism** for secure session extension.
- Handles **invalid or expired JWT tokens gracefully**.
